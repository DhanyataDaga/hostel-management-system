### üöÄ Future Enhancements

* **Backend Integration:** Connecting the frontend to a real backend built with Node.js, Express, and a MongoDB database to handle live data.
* **Real-Time Notifications:** Implementing a system for real-time alerts for students and admins.
* **Detailed Analytics:** Adding charts and graphs to the admin dashboard to visualize bookings and revenue.
* **Unit & E2E Testing:** Writing tests to ensure the application is robust and reliable.
